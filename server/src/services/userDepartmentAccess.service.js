// Ticket.managerId are left untouched elsewhere and are no longer read for
// this decision anywhere in the codebase.
//
// The two roles that use this table have DIFFERENT multiplicity rules:
//   MANAGER  — may hold several rows (multi-department), no per-department cap.
//   TEAMLEAD — holds EXACTLY ONE row; a department may hold at most
//              MAX_TEAMLEADS_PER_DEPARTMENT such rows across all its TEAMLEADs.
// Every mutating function below enforces the calling/target user's actual
// role — never a client-supplied assumption of which rule should apply.
