// default = Raised by Me, or "assigned" = Assigned to Me). This is NOT
// separate sidebar pages; switching either control only changes this
// component's own content, it never navigates away from /agent/queue.
// `key` forces a clean remount on switch so TicketsListPage's own internal
// filter state (status/search/etc, initialized once from the URL) never
// leaks between fundamentally different ticket sets.
//
// Backend scopes reused as-is (ticket.service.js#scopeWhereForTab):
// scope=created -> requesterId = me, regardless of department; scope=
// assigned -> assigneeId = me. Both are self-sufficient authorization
// rules the server already enforces — this page only ever selects WHICH
// of the server's own scopes to request, never filters a full dataset
// client-side.

  // I'm authorized to see," not "search only what I personally raised." So
  // the default view when `view` is entirely absent depends on whether a
  // search is active: no search -> "my" (the existing default, e.g. from
  // the sidebar "Tickets" link); a search present -> "department" (the
  // broadest tab an Agent has), so a department ticket the Agent didn't
  // raise is still found instead of silently narrowed to Raised by Me. An
  // EXPLICIT ?view=my|department (from actually clicking a tab) always
  // wins either way.
  // Global search mode: arrived with a search term but no EXPLICIT tab
  // choice — the query must use the broadest "authorized" scope (every
  // ticket this Agent may view: department + anything they personally
  // raised, see ticket.service.js#scopeWhereForTab's "authorized" branch),
  // never a tab's own restrictive scope. The moment the Agent explicitly
  // clicks a tab (?view= appears in the URL), that tab's real scope takes
  // over exactly as before — this only affects the unparameterized
  // "just searched" landing state.
